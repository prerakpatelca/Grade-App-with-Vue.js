# Grade-App-with-Vue.js
Used a component-based front-end framework VueJS to create a web application

Created an application using Vue.js which allows an instructor to manage and analyze a list of grades associated with courses. The functionality are implemented using Vue.js in the expected ways (e.g. using templates, directives, Vue instance data, computed properties, etc.).

The focus of the application are list of grades, with each grade having an associated course name.
